    <h1>Fuck You Guys</h1>
    <p>The images you sent me are encoded in .HIEC, which apparently HTML5 wont support.
        Therefore I had to go through the process of converting them to .JPG format so I can use them in this experiment.
        On top of fucking that, when I embeded them in their original resolution they were absurdly huge.

        <p>I had to go all the way around looking for how to lower resolution without loosing quality. I actually found something pretty fucking
        dope, I'm gonna bookmark it. But <a href="https://www.befunky.com/">here's the link.</a>
