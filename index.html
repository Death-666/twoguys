    <h1>Thank You For Giving Me Something To Do</h1>
    <p>Not much is going on in life. I don't intend to make this a full detailed thing.
        I just thought, if I'm so sad, feel so hopeless, and have nothing to do, then maybe I should do a 
        Web Page. I like computers, they dont make me sad, althought they could. Phones bring sadness tho. It's harsh.
        Sometimes the right phone call or the right text at the right time in the perfect moment <em><strong>could 
        save a life.</strong></em> Maybe today you guys saved mine. It's lonely over here. Life has 
        ups and downs, but if I can get this hosted online and you guys open it up and it works then that
        would be a moment in my life that's <b>up.</b>

    <p>My son is running around, it's a cute thing; somehow excruciatingly painful as well.
        We're 24 lines of code in now, seems fun, but I'm running out of fuel. I've been wondering when should I give
        ya'll those pictures. Been thinking about how to make it silly or funny. But all I can really do now is add text.
        Practice.. Practice.. No?
        I'll link a video on youtube, maybe. 
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1lTVvuQTTk">This will take you to a cat video on
            YouTube, Fucking Adds.</a></li> 
        </ul>
